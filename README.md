## Introduction

Hi There :raising_hand_woman:


Meet Surbhi Sanchita, a Software Engineer by profession. In a world where career paths are often carefully chosen, I took a delightful detour. Picture this: a curious mind who once tried to order a pizza online but ended up debugging the website or code instead. It was love at first byte! :upside_down_face:

Despite not being a code fanatic by nature, I bring a fresh perspective to the world of software engineering. I always prefer to  approach each project with a blend of curiosity, practicality, and a touch of humor—because if you can’t laugh at a stubborn bug, what can you laugh at? :slightly_smiling_face:


✨**The technologies I have used in this project**✨

1. Selenium Webdriver
2. Java
3. Jenkins
4. TestNG
5. CI/CD Integration of Selenium Framework with Git Hub remote repository


I wanted to deepen my understanding of frameworks, so I embarked on creating one from scratch. As a result, I developed a framework from the ground up for an e-commerce application.




✨**Frameowrk Explanation**✨

1. I have used Page Object concept here to dsign this framework from scratch, it is java design pattern used to develop and test web pages. I have created page object Model class to develop and store resuable methods. 

2. For every webpage present in the ecommerce application, I created a java class with the page name.
3. To declare the elements in POM class ,I have used FindBy annotation.
4. Capturing screenshot for failed TC's are taken care by Listeners, All the tests will start their journey from Listeners
